                <p>I'm currently a Junior pursuing a dual-major in Computer Science and Finance with a Mathematics minor at Santa Clara University.</p>
                <p>This path lets me dive deep into both worlds;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The engineering side, where I learn how computers work, how computing systems are built and optimized to deliver results to the user</li>
                    <li>The business side, focusing on case studies following an MBA-style curriculum in management, marketing, and financial strategy</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Balancing both has been challenging but incredibly rewarding.</p>
                <p>It's taught me how to think like an engineer while making decisions like a business leader. It's the foundation that drives my passion for building products that are not only technically sound but strategically impactful.</p>
