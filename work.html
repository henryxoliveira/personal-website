                    </div>

                </div>
                <p><strong>I co-founded a parking management platform company called Parkd</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is an end-to-end system delivering permit registration, vehicle management, and remote parking enforcement to schools and universities</li>
                    <li>We use a trained license plate reading ML model and adapt it to existing school cameras to remove the need for physical parking inspection</li>
                    <li>We have both an admin-side for managing and enforcing parking, and a user side, for buying and managing permits</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>I'm currently leading a team of 3 student engineers to build Parkd</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is written mainly in JavaScript, with a React frontend and Node backend, making API calls to our AWS DynamoDB database of permits, student accounts</li>
                    <li>I also designed our frontend on Figma, focusing on making the process as easy and intuitive as possible for all end users</li>
                    <li>We host weekly team meetings and code reviews to ensure we hit our deadlines on time</li>
                    <li>We also automate our CI/CD pipelines with GitHub and Docker, managing dev/staging/production branches
                        <ul>
                            <li>This allows for automated testing, reduced deployment time, ensuring zero-downtime rollouts, and A/B testing of new features.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>We also take security very seriously with full SSO integration with the existing school infrastructure (via Auth0), and TLS encryption of APIs</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>We're partnered with Santa Clara University (our school) and Bellarmine College Prep (a local high school) for pilots of our platform</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We began outreach around June of 2025, a few weeks after we began working on it, and rolled out to Bellarmine in September 2025</li>
                    <li>Their entire parking management system runs on Parkd, managing an estimated $100K per year in school revenue via parking permits</li>
                    <li>With SCU, we're still integrating with our school's camera system, but progress is coming soon (lots of bureaucracy and approvals to overcome first)</li>
                </ul>
