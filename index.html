                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I'm a junior at Santa Clara University, class of '27, studying Computer Science and Finance, with a minor in Mathematics.</p>
                    
                    <p>Over the past few years, I've gained hands-on experience across startups, venture capital, and software development, most recently leading product development and GTM for my own startup, Parkd. I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and business teams, whether that means coding, shaping product strategy, or driving customer adoption.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="about-personal">Outside of school and work, I'm usually playing guitar, staying active through fitness, or tending to a growing collection of plants. I love being outdoors and finding creative outlets like photography and chess that balance my analytical side. Looking ahead, I'm excited to keep growing as a product-minded engineer and future product manager, with a focus on solving problems that matter and working with teams to bring ideas to life.</p>

        <section id="work">
            <h1 class="section-header">Work Experience</h1>
            <p>I've worked across startups and venture capital (as an intern), and volunteered across many university organizations, gaining hands-on experience at the intersection of business and technology.</p>
            
            <p>My work ranges from sourcing startups for Battery Ventures, to guiding cybersecurity product development at Permiso, to ultimately founding my own startup Parkd. In my experience, I built a track record of tackling challenges that require both technical and strategic thinking.</p>
            
            <p>At Santa Clara University, I serve as a student advisor for BEACH entrepreneurship clinic of the Ciocca Center, and as advisor to the technology sector of the Santa Clara Investment Fund. I've also volunteered in Latinx-related organizations as Treasurer of the Latinx Student Union and as Head of External Affairs for the Latinx Business Student Organizations. Here, I try to empower and mentor those of a similar underrepresented background.</p>
            
            <p>Throughout my journey, I gained expertise in software engineering, product management, and technology investing, and learned a lot about working with groups of highly talented individuals to deliver spectacular results. Check out more of my work in the link.</p>

        <section id="projects">
            <h1 class="section-header">Projects</h1>
            <p>I'm teaching myself to code through project-based learning, and publishing my projects as I go along.</p>
            
            <p>Right now, my main project is Parkd, the startup I co-founded to bring a better parking system to schools and universities. Parkd has been a major crash course in engineering, product, and business development. I've been very hands-on across the stack, from LPR hardware, to building out payments, SSO integrations, and admin tools. I've also learned a lot about B2B sales, integrating software to existing workflows, and leading a team of engineers to build something new.</p>
            
            <p>This website is my space to experiment with web development with HTML and CSS while also showcasing what I've been working on.</p>
            
            <p>As I grow in my programming skills, I'll keep adding new projects here, whether that's hackathons, side builds, or just fun experiments. Think of this page as a growing collection of the stuff I'm building along the way.</p>

        <section id="publications">
            <h1 class="section-header">Publications</h1>
            <p>Here are some publications I authored. On my Substack, Growing Exponentially, I write essays and journals exploring trends in AI, startups, cybersecurity, and other broader technology themes. I've co-authored research for the Santa Clara Investment Fund, published industry memos, and am currently working on research projects with the Santa Clara University Computer Science Department.</p>
            
            <p>This mix of personal writing and academic work which I think reflects how I like to think; connecting practical experience with deeper analysis. You can find highlights of my work below, and for the latest updates, follow along on my socials.</p>
